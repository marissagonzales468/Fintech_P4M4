This application aims to offer users a one-stop online 
investment solution for their retirement portfolios that’s 
both inexpensive and high quality. To keep the costs low, the 
application uses algorithms to build each users portfolio  to 
determine the fund with the most investment potential based on 
key risk-management metrics: 
the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios,and betas.

Technologies
[ ]:

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:
​
* [numpy](https://numpy.org) - Numpy provides an extensive
package of mathematcal functions, random number generators, 
and other compendious functions. Ultimately, it 'cleans' 
the data to give it a more uniform look discarding rid all the
"dirty data". 
* [matplotlib](https://tinyurl.com/5yvhz3mm) - 
matplotlib visualizes the written data by plotting it directly
below the code cell that produces it. Users have the option 
looking at the data side by side. The resulting plots will then be 
stored in the document.
